# Deliberative Poll data

This repository is the source catalog and build system for data shared across
Deliberative Poll research projects. It separates immutable source files from
documented transformations and versioned exports.

The repository establishes provenance before changing any analysis:

- public replication deposits are stored byte-for-byte with checksums;
- all 23 Cor–Sood poll-level scored knowledge batteries are extracted and cataloged;
- historical CDD archive members retain their original paths and checksums;
  unique unreviewed files remain in the local vault;
- poll names and legacy numeric identifiers map to stable `poll_id` values;
- data, questionnaires, codebooks, briefing materials, research designs,
  event reports, papers, and scripts share one artifact contract;
- scoring definitions and unresolved recoding questions are recorded; and
- downstream repositories consume a tagged export and verify its checksum.

`metadata/oos_sources.csv` locates the 24 frozen public inputs and supporting
documents used by the dp-distortions out-of-sample study. It retains original
URLs, access dates and SHA-256 hashes; shared files have one physical copy under
`data/<study>/`. Study-specific recoding and estimation remain downstream.
Blank source license fields mean no license was recorded during this migration;
they do not assign the repository license to third-party materials.

Direct identifiers were found in at least one historical raw file. The archive
therefore cannot be published as an undifferentiated dump. See
[`docs/disclosure.md`](docs/disclosure.md).

The survey-based build covers all 23 knowledge batteries: 6,669 participants,
103,116 item-wave responses, and 406 known discussion groups. Five typed
Parquet tables in `output/` preserve source answers, scoring decisions and
missing values. Group membership is available for 6,147 participants.
The [build notes](docs/knowledge-build.md) describe the output contract.
The [fourteen-poll audit](docs/remaining-polls.md) explains corrected scores,
three unresolved sample-size differences, Europolis's unordered match, and
Vermont's ambiguous answer key. These outputs do not yet rebuild the full
attitude aggregate or the control-arm batteries.

The historical knowledge–attitude linkage is also built here with `make linkage`.
Its five CSV products and checksum manifest live in `output/linkage/`, replacing
the standalone linkage repository. It retains historical `polardata` scores and
links for now; see the [linkage contract](docs/knowledge-build.md#historical-knowledgeattitude-linkage).

Known measurement, sample, linkage, and provenance questions are collected in the
[poll-level issue register](docs/poll-issues.md). It distinguishes documented
choices from unresolved concerns and existing upstream differences; this review
preserves current scores pending instrument-level verification.

`make respondents` reconstructs all 848 historical respondent-field targets
across 21 polls. It retains every reviewed source record, separates named
samples from people, and records versioned recodes and their raw inputs.
`make polardata` then computes group and poll summaries and exports the full
6,084-row, 364-column historical schema under `output/polardata/`, together
with the 129-row attitude-index catalog and a typed derived-measure table.
The historical Primaries export contains two copies of each of 217 people;
canonical respondent tables retain one record per person.

The build reads public poll sources, not frozen aggregates or the vault.
`make compare-respondents` and `make compare-polardata` separately test against
historical benchmarks. Documented numerical exceptions concern generalized
variance in 24 groups; the comparison checks the exact source matrices and
numerical diagnostics before accepting those differences. Export row numbers
are regenerated. See the [parity report](audit/polardata_parity.csv),
[covariance audit](audit/polardata_covariances.csv), and
[poll issue register](docs/poll-issues.md) for details.

Historical coding choices are preserved for later review. Existing knowledge
and linkage products remain unchanged, and downstream repositories remain
pinned to their existing inputs. The new reconstruction is a separate output
that can be assessed before downstream adoption.

## Reproduce

```sh
make restore
make check
```

`make check` validates the Frictionless Data Package, source checksums,
metadata contracts, the survey-based build, historical linkage, item-level
comparisons, respondent and full aggregate reconstruction, tests, and linting.
The original CDD inventory in `audit/cdd_archive_files.csv` preserves every
archive member's original path and hash. Its `retained_path` points to the
surviving copy after deduplication, either under `data/` or in the local vault.
Migration-only import and survey-review commands verify that copy's checksum.
The unpacking and inventory-rebuilding commands have been retired; normal builds
read the registered poll inputs under `data/` and need no archive extraction.
Original bundle checksums remain in `metadata/source_bundles.csv` as provenance.
The disclosure scan, survey import, archive comparison, and downstream source
audit are also migration tools; they can be retired as their source-review work
is completed.

Northern Ireland's paper can run from the public source tree: it uses the numeric
survey, headerless group roster, and `argument-codes.parquet` under
`data/northern-ireland-2007/`. Coder labels retain all response slots and missing
values; adjudication and scoring remain in dp-nireland. The extract excludes
verbatim responses and records the original source hash in the artifact catalog.

## Repository roles

| Location | Role |
|---|---|
| `data/<poll_id>/` | Reviewed data and metadata for one poll |
| `evidence/benchmarks/` | Frozen published aggregates for comparisons and historical linkage |
| `evidence/deposits/` | Immutable public deposits awaiting poll-level extraction |
| `metadata/` | Poll registry, source catalog, aliases, recodes, export contracts |
| `datapackage.json` | Frictionless schemas for the tabular metadata |
| `R/`, `scripts/` | Validation and build code |
| `output/` | Typed Parquet products built from audited poll-level inputs |
| `vault/` | Ignored local source archive, including restricted files |

The architecture and migration order are documented in
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

`metadata/artifacts.csv` is the authoritative artifact catalog. Poll-level
`manifest.csv` files are generated from it, so descriptive metadata is not
maintained twice. A blank `poll_id` denotes a collection-wide artifact rather
than an unknown poll. Source materials live in the relevant poll's
`questionnaires/`, `codebooks/`, `briefing-materials/`, `papers/`, `reports/`, or
`design/` directory. Cross-poll references and historical definition versions
have one copy under `data/shared/`; poll manifests point to that same file.
Original archive paths, download URLs, checksums, and comparison limitations are
recorded in the central catalog. Identical copies are consolidated; different
versions remain separate.

`LICENSE` covers this repository's code. Data retain the license recorded for
each input in `metadata/source_files.csv`. Reference materials retain their
source copyrights; `NOASSERTION` means no redistribution license has been
established, not that the material is covered by the repository license.
Restricted respondent files remain in the local vault. Exact historical CDD scripts are retained
in Git history under the `historical-cdd-scripts` tag, not beside the maintained
pipeline on `main`.

The aggregate `polardata` and attitude-index files are validation targets, not
inputs to the canonical build. Canonical long tables will be assembled from
audited poll-level respondent, item, wave, group, and artifact records. Their
released form can be typed Parquet, with small dictionaries and manifests kept
as CSV for inspection and joins.

## Cor–Sood knowledge batteries

The 23 files in `data/<poll_id>/knowledge-battery.csv` are exact bytes from
`replication/data.zip` inside the [public Cor–Sood Dataverse deposit](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HZHVCU).
`metadata/knowledge_batteries.csv` records the original ZIP member, paired
pre/post item columns, respondent and item counts, and linkage status. For
some polls the post-deliberation columns are named `t3`; the column map
preserves those names rather than relabeling the actual survey wave.

These files contain scored 0/1 item responses and `female`, but no original
answer choices, respondent IDs, group assignments, or attitudes. A row number
is only an index within that deposited CSV. The files can reproduce the
knowledge-battery analysis; they cannot by themselves regenerate
`polardata` or establish a respondent-level join to it. The original CDD
survey files and scripts in the local vault must be audited poll by poll
before the full aggregate is rebuilt. Published aggregates in
`evidence/benchmarks/` remain comparison targets for the canonical build and
explicit inputs to the historical linkage build.
